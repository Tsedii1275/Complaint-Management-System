# Complaint Management System - Frontend

React frontend for the Flowable-based Complaint Management System.

## Features

- **Customer Complaint Form**: Submit new complaints with automatic ticket generation
- **Role-based Task Management**: Each role has its own dedicated page
  - Branch Staff: First contact resolution or escalation
  - CMD Officer: Complaint screening and categorization
  - Audit Team: Investigation and approval/rejection
  - Work Unit: Final resolution implementation
  - Service Quality: Sensitive case notifications

## Workflow

1. Customer submits complaint → Ticket generated
2. Branch Staff handles → Resolves OR sends to CMD
3. CMD screens → Sets category/priority → Sends to Audit OR Work Unit
4. Audit investigates → Approves (to Work Unit) OR Rejects (close)
5. Work Unit resolves → Marks sensitivity
6. Service Quality/CMD notifies customer → Case closed
